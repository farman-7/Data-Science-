    "**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the simulation of human intelligence processes by computer systems. AI can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing speech and images, and making decisions. AI can be divided into two main categories:\n",
    "\n",
    ">i) Narrow or Weak AI<br>\n",
    ">ii) General or Strong AI<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** One example of AI is self-driving cars. These cars use computer vision and machine learning algorithms to analyze their surroundings and make decisions based on that analysis. They can navigate traffic, avoid obstacles, and make decisions based on traffic laws and road conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning (ML):-**\n",
    "**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI that uses statistical techniques to enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task by learning from data without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms can recognize patterns in data and use those patterns to make predictions or decisions. Machine learning algorithms can be classified into three main categories:\n",
    "\n",
    ">i) Supervised Learning<br>\n",
    ">ii) Unsupervised Learning<br>\n",
    ">iii) Reinforcement Learning<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** An example of machine learning is email filtering. Email providers like Gmail use machine learning algorithms to classify incoming emails as spam or not spam. The algorithm learns from patterns in the text and other features of the email to make a prediction about whether the email is spam or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deep Learning (DL):-**\n",
    "**Deep Learning (DL)** is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to model and solve complex problems. Deep learning algorithms use multiple layers of interconnected nodes to process and learn from data. Deep learning is capable of learning from unstructured data such as images, videos, and audio.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** An example of deep learning is image recognition. Deep learning models can be trained to identify objects within images, such as cars or people. These models use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze the features of an image and classify it into different categories based on those features. For example, a deep learning model could be trained to identify different breeds of dogs within a photo."

The objective of the model is to learn a mapping between input features and the corresponding output. The labeled data is used to train the model, and the model is then tested on new, unseen data.

The goal of unsupervised learning is to gain insights into the data and discover interesting relationships or anomalies that can be further explored or used for decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semi-supervised learning:-** In semi-supervised learning, the model is trained on a combination of labeled and unlabeled data. The labeled data is used to guide the learning process, while the unlabeled data is used to improve the generalization performance of the model. Semi-supervised learning can be useful when labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain. The goal of semi-supervised learning is to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data while using as much of the available data as possible."

Clustering, density estimation, dimensionality reduction, and one-class classification are common unsupervised learning techniques used for anomaly detection. By identifying anomalies in the data, we can detect abnormal behavior or events that require further investigation.\n",

    "**For example,** clustering algorithms can be used to group similar data points together and identify anomalies as data points that do not belong to any cluster or belong to a very small cluster. Density estimation algorithms can be used to estimate the probability distribution of the data and identify anomalies as data points with low probability. Dimensionality reduction algorithms can be used to reduce the number of features in the data while preserving the most important information, and identify anomalies as data points that are far away from the majority of the data in the reduced space.
