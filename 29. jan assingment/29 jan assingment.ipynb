    "                         Python supports imperative programming through its use of control structures, such as loops and conditional statements.\n",

    "                              actions that can be performed on them. Python has built-in support for object-oriented programming, including features such as classes, \n",
    "                              inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming:- This is a type of programming that involves defining functions that take inputs and produce outputs, without the use of mutable state. \n",
    "                         Python has limited support for functional programming, but it does include features such as lambda functions and first-class functions.\n",
